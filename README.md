This is a basic guide to get started with HTML learning and setup.

## 📌 What is HTML?
HTML (**HyperText Markup Language**) is the standard markup language for creating webpages.  
It defines the **structure** of a website.

## 🖥️ Installation Process

You don’t need a special compiler to run HTML.  
Any modern **web browser** (like **Google Chrome**, **Mozilla Firefox**, or **Microsoft Edge**) can interpret and run HTML files directly.  

### Steps:
1. Install a code editor (recommended: **Visual Studio Code**).  
2. Create a new folder (e.g., `my-first-html-project`).  
3. Inside the folder, create a file named `index.html`.  
4. Write the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my very first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
````

5. Save the file.
6. Right-click on the file → **Open With Browser** (or open with Chrome).
7. 🎉 Your first webpage will appear in the browser!
